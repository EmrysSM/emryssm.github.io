            Hello, my name is Emrys and I am a software engineering lead with
            over nine years of experience in the tech industry. I enjoy
            leveraging my breadth of knowledge, communication skills, and
            management capabilities to drive measurable changes on my projects.

            I am originally from Norfolk, Virginia where I spent my childhood.
            In my early teens I spent a short period of time living in
            Washington DC before my family moved back to Virginia. In my mid
            twenties I moved to Rochester, New York while attending School, and
            then settled in Atlanta, Georgia to begin my current career. In my
            free time I enjoy getting out to a good restaraunt, enjoying a local
            beer, or to catch an Atlanta United game. I also try to stay active
            by going to the gym and feel great after pushing myself. For my
            downtime, I like working on computers or playing videogames.

            My current role is as a lead technical specialist for GRASP at the
            CDC. My responsibilities include GIS development, ArcGIS enterprise
            administration, and system design and project architecting, and the
            occasional big data analytics. Previously, I worked for a
            transportation engineering firm as a senior developer, led a team of
            software engineers, worked directly with clients, and participated
            in sales pursuits as the technical lead. With a focus on custom web
            applications, I have lead the production of porducts that range from
            internal business and project mamagement tools to websites and
            surveying apps for public use. I have interfaced with third party
            systems that include ESRI products like WebApp Builder, and ArcGIS
            Enterprise. Along with my experience in developing custom
            applications I have developed a felxibility to work with many
            technologies and tech stacks. Languages I am comfortable in are
            primarily JavaScript and Python. I have used them both in a backend
            capacity with Node and Django, mated with either a SQL or NoSQL
            database. Serving out APIs in ways such as REST or GraphQL, my
            frontend experience primarily includes REACT and Vue. Before
            software engineering I started my career by providing server and
            networking services to local businesses, which gave me a strong
            foundation in systems, architecture, working with clients and
            meeting their business needs. I graduated from Georgia State
            University with a BS in Computer Science.
